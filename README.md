# Professorlocke
Pokemon Informational Quiz (base quiz)

What is the Professorlocke?

I wanted to spice up my challenge of a nuzlocke in Pokemon, and improve my knowledge of a franchise I love. So I wanted to make a quiz I could take and stream.

This is that quiz. It pulls from PokéApi.co for Pokémon and species data, plays a victory tune, displays a sprite, and holds you to your standard.

If you want to see the work in action, please check me out on twitch.tv/fabledtyromancer or youtube.com/@FabledTyromancer. Or, if you just want to support me, those are the best ways.

You are free to modify this code, branch it, etc, just provide some credit to me for the idea, share this repository, and have fun. I'm ass at coding, this was literally my first project (and used some LLM assistance... hence any really weird crap), so if you have suggestions for revisions, ways to improve it, or just want to see me do something, reach out to me at fabledtyromancer@gmail.com.

My eternal thanks to the wonderful Chlotendo for her help and patience!
